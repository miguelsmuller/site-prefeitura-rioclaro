## **OVERVIEW**
Implementation of the UI redesign that was presented at [**Behance**](https://www.behance.net/gallery/80414855/Redesign-Rio-Claro-City-Hall-Website) developed for study purposes for Rio Claro City Hall in the State of Rio Janeiro. The original site done in [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.org/) and is online at [**rioclaro.rj.gov.br**](https://rioclaro.rj.gov.br/) and  the new concept being developed in **[Angular](https://angular.io/)** and you can see the redesign version [**here**](https://miguelsmuller.github.io/pmrc-site/).

**Angular** which is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps. It is for building the application interface using HTML, CSS and, mainly, JavaScript, created by Google's developers and has some basic elements that make this construction interesting, within them we can highlight the components, templates, directives, routing, modules, services, dependency injection and infrastructure tools that automate tasks, such as executing the unit tests of an application.

# **DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION**  
## **PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**  
### **INSTALL ALL DEPENDENCIES**
Make sure that you also have **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** and **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)** installed on your computer.
- **`$ node --version`** 
- **`$ npm --version`** 

Also make sure you have **Angular CLI** and **Ionic CLI** installed globally on your machine.  
- **`$ npm install -g @angular/cli @ionic/cli`**  

Install dependencies of project with:  
- **`$ npm install`**

<br>

## **RUNNING LOCALLY**  
Run te command  
**`$ ng serve`**

<br>

## **PROJECT WORKFLOW**  
This workflow uses two main branches to record the project's history. The **`master`** branch stores the official release history, and the **`develop`** branch serves as a resource integration branch.

The branch **`master`** is the branch that runs in the production environment. All commits on the **`master`** branch must have a version number.

Each new resource must reside on its own branch and must start from the **`develop`** branch. When a feature is completed, it is merged back into **`develop`**. Resources should never interact directly with the master.

The branch **`develop`** is the branch that runs in the test environment. It stores the latest features included in the projects and which are not yet able to enter the branch **`master`**.
